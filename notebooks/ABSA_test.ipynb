We arrived and put our name down for a table and were told 30 min wait, sure no problem. I went ahead and checked in again after 40 min and still nothing. Finally after 1hr we got a table. Since it was already late and we were starving we knew what we wanted and ordered right away.  We ordered a Margarita pizza and two empanadas. The margarita pizza was a Plain cheese pizza. The two empanadas: one was chicken the other capris. They both had cold centers. It was terrible! We ask for the check right after and got nothing! I had to get up and bring my credit card to the waitress to the cash register. It was just terrible service and terrible food. Spain is really disappointing me In the food department. ',\n",

       "  'review': 'I visited this placed yesterday to catch a quick bite before heading for the airport. We were greeted by a young man at the entrance who told use we could choose where we sat. We sat down and spent the next 5min or so being ignored. My partner was getting annoyed even so that the 3 young lads at the next table picked up on this and gave us their menus as they had already orderd. Again we spent some time being ignored before we stopped one of the staff walking by to take our order. The good came out quite quickly and to be fair it was very good. After we had finished we again had to ask the staff to clear the table and give us a dessert menu. The lad that we hsd asked wss just finishing and he told us to ask one of his other colleagues who he pointed to. My partner went over and asked for the menu and was told that there was none and that he had had to go inside the restaurant to the counter and pick out what he wanted which was on display and then tell her.  When I went to the counter to pay the male member behind the counter was on his phone. The female member that was there had to hit him with a washcloth to get his attention that I was there. I was paying by card and he never spoke to me and just gestured with his head to ask me to remove my card. The food here is good but the staff definitely need to be given a course on good customer service. I could understand this attitude if the place was seriously under pressure and extremely busy but the place was fairly quiet.',\n",

The premises are small, about 20 covers, and there’s no booking so you just have to turn up early. Fortunately we did. It’s cash only but for 40€ you can have the house selection for two – plentiful plates of delicious food (no fish or seafood) including Iberian ham and warm bread with tomato paste. Details like the warm bread – it’s often cold – mark this place down as the superior experience that it is. Our server, Kate, was delightful and helpful in equal measure. The wine list is short but appropriate. Highly recommended.',\n",

We asked for more meat than veggies. The veggie tapas had mushrooms and eggplant which my husband doesn't like so I ended up eating those tapas and they turned out to be really tasty. The meat ones were good, too. The jamon iberico appetizer was really good!! Our server was very attentive and checked in on us just enough. We definitely recommend this place.\",\n",

Its found in an unassuming location, with just a few tables (only 4 tables the night we went there) & with 1-on-1 service. The waitrons go the extra mile to explain the food and preparation to you. The staff also accomodates you in any way they can. On the day we went, I had specified that my husband was allergic to seafood on the online booking form, in Spain, seafood means \"shellfish\", so the restaurant assumed he would eat fish. Upon arriving there we explainrd this to them and the chef made a replacement meal for his fish dishes on such short notice - I was really impressed with this.  I predict a Michelin Star in their future. ',\n",

Tucked away on a narrow street, the unassuming facade hides a small intimate restaurant with only about half a dozen tables.  Guests can either opt for the tasting menu with set dishes or let the chef surprise them (same price, both are 65EUR for 9 courses)! We opted for the chef's choice and were delighted. Each dish is beautifully presented with exquisite flavours and textures. Our courses included slow-cooked pancetta that melted in your mouth, a creamy rice with half a dozen different mushrooms, smoked fish and a succulent Iberico pork.  I opted for the wine pairing (30 EUR) and was thrilled with the variety of the all-Spanish wines that were served, My partner prefers to drink beer and our server went out of his way to find a special beer that matched his taste.  In fact, that set the tone for the entire evening with some of the best service I have experienced: friendly without being the overbearing formality you sometimes find in fine restaurants. The two servers were also very knowledgable about the food and wine. And with only 6 tables they had time for a chat here and there. The staff also speak excellent English.  I can't wait for the next menu to come out so we have an excuse to go back!\",\n",

He found the perfect balance between being warm and funny without ever crossing any line. For example, he realized my husband was a leftie and placed his forks accordingly during the whole meal.  Now about the food. We ordered the Tradional Tasting Menu. The pumpkin gnocci and the oyster were my favorites, but my husband felt more inclined towards the excellent slowed cooked lamb and the egg dish, of which he said he would have eaten a bucket.  All in all a TOP OF THE NOTCH dining with even a few surprises like the amazing tasting of the Sichuan Flower.  We will come back, for sure. ',\n",

Reservation by Whatsapp was easy and friendly. We were received very well. For us the decoration is not exactly our taste but it was roomy, clean and from the start all staff were absolutely awesome. The service was friendly, very knowledgeable and made great suggestions. Though there are some more tourist friendly straightforward dishes. But there were also a whole bunch of interesting dishes. The bread they served was fresh and fantastic, we shared 3 starters, each even better than the previous. Surprisingly original, tasty, extremely well served. Great to look at and even better in taste. Then we shared two main dishes. Which were spectacular. Extremely well thought out and executed. One of the younger waiters made a great suggestion for a desert to share and we decided to go for it. We were not disappointed, it was the perfect finish to a great dinner. In a few words, great, friendly, knowledgeable service, a bunch of really interesting and surprising dishes, extremely well designed and executed. And for extremely reasonable prices. Fantastic value for money. I'd say that despite the decoration that was absolutely not our style, this place is for us #1 in value for money in 5 years of restaurants in Barcelona. And definitely in our top 3 overall for its anazing food and amazing service.\",\n",

We arrived and put our name down for a table and were told 30 min wait, sure no problem. I went ahead and checked in again after 40 min and still nothing. Finally after 1hr we got a table. Since it was already late and we were starving we knew what we wanted and ordered right away.  We ordered a Margarita pizza and two empanadas. The margarita pizza was a Plain cheese pizza. The two empanadas: one was chicken the other capris. They both had cold centers. It was terrible! We ask for the check right after and got nothing! I had to get up and bring my credit card to the waitress to the cash register. It was just terrible service and terrible food. Spain is really disappointing me In the food department. ',\n",

We sat down and spent the next 5min or so being ignored. My partner was getting annoyed even so that the 3 young lads at the next table picked up on this and gave us their menus as they had already orderd. Again we spent some time being ignored before we stopped one of the staff walking by to take our order. The good came out quite quickly and to be fair it was very good. After we had finished we again had to ask the staff to clear the table and give us a dessert menu. The lad that we hsd asked wss just finishing and he told us to ask one of his other colleagues who he pointed to. My partner went over and asked for the menu and was told that there was none and that he had had to go inside the restaurant to the counter and pick out what he wanted which was on display and then tell her.  When I went to the counter to pay the male member behind the counter was on his phone. The female member that was there had to hit him with a washcloth to get his attention that I was there. I was paying by card and he never spoke to me and just gestured with his head to ask me to remove my card. The food here is good but the staff definitely need to be given a course on good customer service. I could understand this attitude if the place was seriously under pressure and extremely busy but the place was fairly quiet.',\n",

The premises are small, about 20 covers, and there’s no booking so you just have to turn up early. Fortunately we did. It’s cash only but for 40€ you can have the house selection for two – plentiful plates of delicious food (no fish or seafood) including Iberian ham and warm bread with tomato paste. Details like the warm bread – it’s often cold – mark this place down as the superior experience that it is. Our server, Kate, was delightful and helpful in equal measure. The wine list is short but appropriate. Highly recommended.',\n",

The workers told us it's the same restaurant, just a different location. The food was amazing. We allowed them to select our tapas after they asked us a few questions. We asked for more meat than veggies. The veggie tapas had mushrooms and eggplant which my husband doesn't like so I ended up eating those tapas and they turned out to be really tasty. The meat ones were good, too. The jamon iberico appetizer was really good!! Our server was very attentive and checked in on us just enough. We definitely recommend this place.\",\n",

Its found in an unassuming location, with just a few tables (only 4 tables the night we went there) & with 1-on-1 service. The waitrons go the extra mile to explain the food and preparation to you. The staff also accomodates you in any way they can. On the day we went, I had specified that my husband was allergic to seafood on the online booking form, in Spain, seafood means \"shellfish\", so the restaurant assumed he would eat fish. Upon arriving there we explainrd this to them and the chef made a replacement meal for his fish dishes on such short notice - I was really impressed with this.  I predict a Michelin Star in their future. ',\n",

       "  'review': \"We picked this restaurant to celebrate our first anniversary of moving to Barcelona and we could not have made a better choice! Tucked away on a narrow street, the unassuming facade hides a small intimate restaurant with only about half a dozen tables.  Guests can either opt for the tasting menu with set dishes or let the chef surprise them (same price, both are 65EUR for 9 courses)! We opted for the chef's choice and were delighted. Each dish is beautifully presented with exquisite flavours and textures. Our courses included slow-cooked pancetta that melted in your mouth, a creamy rice with half a dozen different mushrooms, smoked fish and a succulent Iberico pork.  I opted for the wine pairing (30 EUR) and was thrilled with the variety of the all-Spanish wines that were served, My partner prefers to drink beer and our server went out of his way to find a special beer that matched his taste.  In fact, that set the tone for the entire evening with some of the best service I have experienced: friendly without being the overbearing formality you sometimes find in fine restaurants. The two servers were also very knowledgable about the food and wine. And with only 6 tables they had time for a chat here and there. The staff also speak excellent English.  I can't wait for the next menu to come out so we have an excuse to go back!\",\n",

The food was once again amazing and the service very attentive and delightful. They offered to half some of the tapas so we could try more, which was a nice gesture. We had burrata, tuna, patatas bravas, ceviche and carpaccio - all of it very tasty. Next time we visit Barcelona we will definitely be back. ',\n",

He found the perfect balance between being warm and funny without ever crossing any line. For example, he realized my husband was a leftie and placed his forks accordingly during the whole meal.  Now about the food. We ordered the Tradional Tasting Menu. The pumpkin gnocci and the oyster were my favorites, but my husband felt more inclined towards the excellent slowed cooked lamb and the egg dish, of which he said he would have eaten a bucket.  All in all a TOP OF THE NOTCH dining with even a few surprises like the amazing tasting of the Sichuan Flower.  We will come back, for sure. ',\n",

Reservation by Whatsapp was easy and friendly. We were received very well. For us the decoration is not exactly our taste but it was roomy, clean and from the start all staff were absolutely awesome. The service was friendly, very knowledgeable and made great suggestions. Though there are some more tourist friendly straightforward dishes. But there were also a whole bunch of interesting dishes. The bread they served was fresh and fantastic, we shared 3 starters, each even better than the previous. Surprisingly original, tasty, extremely well served. Great to look at and even better in taste. Then we shared two main dishes. Which were spectacular. Extremely well thought out and executed. One of the younger waiters made a great suggestion for a desert to share and we decided to go for it. We were not disappointed, it was the perfect finish to a great dinner. In a few words, great, friendly, knowledgeable service, a bunch of really interesting and surprising dishes, extremely well designed and executed. And for extremely reasonable prices. Fantastic value for money. I'd say that despite the decoration that was absolutely not our style, this place is for us #1 in value for money in 5 years of restaurants in Barcelona. And definitely in our top 3 overall for its anazing food and amazing service.\",\n",
